# ♟️ Kwazam Chess

Kwazam Chess is a GUI-based desktop application developed in Java that enables two players to play standard chess with basic move validation and turn-based functionality. Built with the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, this application applies key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and integrates software design patterns such as **Singleton**, **Observer**, and **Template Method** to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **🧠 Title:** Kwazam Chess  
- **📅 Release:** December 2025  
- **🎯 Purpose:**  
  To demonstrate the practical application of object-oriented design principles and architectural patterns in building a functional desktop chess game. This project emphasizes clean code structure and modular design using MVC and multiple software design patterns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kwazam-chess.git
cd kwazam-chess

### 2. Open in IDE
Launch your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Import the project as a Java or Maven project (based on your configuration).
Ensure that a compatible Java SDK (e.g., Java 17) is properly configured.
### 3. Build and Run
Locate Main.java in the src directory.
Right-click and run the Main class to launch the application.
The chessboard GUI should appear, ready for two-player gameplay.
## 🎮 User Instructions

Launch the game by running Main.java.
A standard 8×8 chessboard GUI will open.
Two players alternate turns:
Click a piece to select it.
Click on a valid target square to make a move.
Basic move validation is implemented:
Illegal moves are blocked.
Turns automatically alternate after each valid move.
The GUI updates dynamically to reflect the game state.
